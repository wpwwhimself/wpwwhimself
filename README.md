# Hello and welcome to my repo! 🤗

My name's [Wojtek](http://wpww.pl) and I am mostly (though not widely) known for my contribution to 🎶 music: I play a few instruments 🎸, I am a member of a few bands 👥 and I commit a few songs 📝 But aside from that, I like coding stuff 🤓 there's something satisfying in typing magic words and seeing pretty things appear on screen 🧙‍♂️

I regularly work in PHP and Javascript. Recently I started using React and I am working on mobile development 📱

## As for coding stuff...

Below you may find websites or programs I made throughout my journey with programming. I update it whenever I can but no promises here, as for some of these it's not viable to copy their contents every time I do something 😕
